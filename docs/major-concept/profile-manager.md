# Profile Manager
---

Profile Manager (aka Delegated Executor) is an address that is allowed to manage a the social operations of a profile (following, posting, commenting, quoting, mirroring, acting).

This was specially motivated by the use case of holding the profile in a secure wallet (e.g. hardware wallet or multisig), and delegating the execution to another wallet (e.g. a hot wallet in your phone).

An owner of the profile can set or revoke one or multiple Profile Managers using configs.
