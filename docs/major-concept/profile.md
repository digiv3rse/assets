# Profile

The Profile NFT is the main object in the DiGi Protocol. It is ownership over this NFT that gives you control of your social graph and content. Individual addresses own ProfileNFTs, and an address can contain multiple ProfileNFTs. What differentiates the DiGi Profile NFT from other on-chain identities is the ability to post Publications to it. The Profile NFT contains the history of all of the posts, quotes, mirrors, comments, and other content you generate.

Additionally, Profile NFTs contain a FollowModule. This module contains the logic that allows different accounts to be issued Follow NFTs to record their relationship to the main profile on-chain.

All social operations and interactions on DiGiProtocol require having a Profile.

DiGi Profile is identified by it's ID, so you can have Profile #1234 or Profile #69420.
