Collect Action is an implementation of Open Action.

Collects allow creators to monetize their content. Because creators own their content via the DiGi Protocol, they are able to allow their followers to purchase that content.

When a user posts a publication to their Profile NFT they have the option to set an Action Module with a CollectAction inside. This action will allow other users to mint NFTs that link to the publication's ContentURI. This action can contain any arbitrary logic to apply to the minting process and the resulting NFT.

A creator can attach a collect action that allows collecting to be open for a certain amount of time or only allow a certain number of collects. Developers can also make their collect actions to add even more functionality!
